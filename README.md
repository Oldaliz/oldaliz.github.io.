1.  MY NAME IS OLDALIZ PEREZ AND MY EMAIL ADDRESS IS OMPEREZEUSTAQUIO@MY.WAKETECH.EDU

2.	My GitHub account, oldaliz.github.io., reflects my passion for web development and open-source projects. I am a computer science student with a keen interest in front-end technologies, and you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React. I actively contribute to a couple of open-source projects, emphasizing collaborative coding and learning from the community. Additionally, I use my GitHub account to store personal coding projects and experiments. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and learning from others, which is why GitHub serves as a hub for my programming endeavors.

3.	The repository "AwesomeWebDevProjects" is a collection of small web development projects that I am working on to enhance my skills and showcase my progress in front-end and back-end technologies. Each project in this repository represents a different aspect of web development, including responsive design, interactivity with JavaScript, and server-side scripting.
These projects range from simple personal portfolio websites to more complex applications like a task management system or a basic social media dashboard. The goal is not only to demonstrate my coding abilities but also to document my learning journey. Each project comes with a README file explaining its purpose, features, and the technologies used.

4.	For this assignment, I chose to clone the repository into my "Projects" folder on the local machine. This provides a centralized location for all my coding projects, making it easy to manage and locate in the future.
Using Git Bash, I navigated to the selected folder and executed the command `git clone`. This command downloaded a copy of the repository onto my computer.
After cloning, I located the README file within the cloned folder using my file explorer. I edited the file to include the required information specified in the assignment instructions.
I opened GitHub Desktop, navigated to the left column, and selected the cloned repository from the list.
In GitHub Desktop, I made the necessary changes to the README file, providing a summary of the modifications in the "Summary" field. I then committed these changes.
To synchronize my local changes with the remote repository on GitHub, I clicked on the "Push origin" button in the top right corner of GitHub Desktop.
Using the Snipping Tool, I captured screenshots of both my repository on GitHub and the cloned folder on my hard drive, ensuring a clear record of the completed assignment.
The entire process was smooth, and following these steps ensures a seamless workflow for future assignments and collaborations.
